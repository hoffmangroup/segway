# Description
The free Segway software package contains a novel method for analyzing multiple
tracks of functional genomics data. Our method uses a dynamic Bayesian network
(DBN) model, which enables it to analyze the entire genome at 1-bp resolution
even in the face of heterogeneous patterns of missing data. This method is the
first application of DBN techniques to genome-scale data and the first genomic
segmentation method designed for use with the maximum resolution data available
from ChIP-seq experiments without downsampling. Our software has extensive
documentation and was designed from the outset with external users in mind.
Researchers at other universities and institutes have already installed and
used Segway for their own projects.
